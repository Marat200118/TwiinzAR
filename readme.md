# AR Experience for Twiinz.world

## Overview

This project was developed as part of a **Bachelor thesis**, showcasing innovative solutions for interactive education using AR technologies.

In collaboration with [Trendwolves], a marketing agency specializing in youth culture, and [Fedustria], the Belgian federation of the textile, wood, and furniture industries, we created an AR experience for [Twiinz.world], a platform that introduces students to the world of Flemish materials and craftsmanship.

This project provides an **immersive AR experience** designed for schools, enabling children to build and customize their dream rooms using their mobile devices. By leveraging modern AR technology, this application eliminates the need for bulky hardware, making it easier for the Twiinz.world team to engage with students interactively and sustainably.
